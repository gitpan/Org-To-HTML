Revision history for Org-To-HTML

0.11    2014-01-29 (SHARYANTO)

        - Replace newlines in non-PRE text with space, so resulting HTML is more
          copy-pasteable to web forms (which sometimes interprets newlines as
          <br />).


0.10    2014-01-25 (SHARYANTO)

        - Forgot to move _included_children() to superclass Org::To::Base.


0.09    2014-01-25 (SHARYANTO)

        - Bugfix: Have not yet loaded String::Escape when logging.

          Org::To::vCard::Addressbook (and other subclasses).
