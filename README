FUNCTIONS
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  org_to_html(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    This is the non-OO interface. For more customization, consider
    subclassing Org::To::HTML.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   css_url => *str*

        Add a link to CSS document.

    *   exclude_tags => *array*

        Exclude trees that carry one of these tags.

        If the whole document doesn't have any of these tags, then the whole
        document will be exported. Otherwise, trees that do not carry one of
        these tags will be excluded. If a selected tree is a subtree, the
        heading hierarchy above it will also be selected for export, but not
        the text below those headings.

        exclude*tags is evaluated after include*tags.

    *   html_title => *str*

        HTML document title, defaults to source_file.

    *   include_tags => *array*

        Include trees that carry one of these tags.

        Works like Org's 'org-export-select-tags' variable. If the whole
        document doesn't have any of these tags, then the whole document
        will be exported. Otherwise, trees that do not carry one of these
        tags will be excluded. If a selected tree is a subtree, the heading
        hierarchy above it will also be selected for export, but not the
        text below those headings.

    *   naked => *bool*

        Don't wrap exported HTML with HTML/HEAD/BODY elements.

    *   source_file => *str*

        Source Org file to export.

    *   source_str => *str*

        Alternatively you can specify Org string directly.

    *   target_file => *str*

        HTML file to write to.

        If not specified, HTML string will be returned.

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array). First element (status) is an
    integer containing HTTP status code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx
    function error). Second element (msg) is a string containing error
    message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third element (result) is optional,
    the actual result. Fourth element (meta) is called result metadata and
    is optional, a hash that contains extra information.
